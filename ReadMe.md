Get Lost Have Fun is a travel blog website that showcases the top travel spots and hidden gems in Metro Manila. It is designed to inspire and guide travelers in exploring the beauty of the city through informative and entertaining blog posts.

This is a personal project of mine to learn and grow my skills in developing websites using React with Next.js and TypeScript. I also used Bootstrap for some of the components of the website and SCSS for easier styling. The backend was made in Express.js and MongoDB as the database.
